# Azure Deployment Runbook

End-to-end deployment of this PocketBase fork to **Azure Container Apps**, with PocketBase's native scheduled backups, telemetry exported to the self-hosted **SigNoz** collector over OTLP, and a custom domain.

> **Logging is SigNoz-only.** Azure Log Analytics and Application Insights were
> retired in [#51](https://github.com/doodlemania2/pocketbase/issues/51) /
> [#52](https://github.com/doodlemania2/pocketbase/issues/52): the Container Apps
> environment ships `appLogsConfiguration.destination: null`, the template holds no
> cross-RG `existing` reference, and the `SHARED_OBS_RG` / `SHARED_LAW_NAME` /
> `SHARED_AI_NAME` variables are gone. Do not reintroduce either service — see
> [Telemetry — OTLP export to SigNoz](#telemetry--otlp-export-to-signoz).

> **Litestream is disabled and has been since 2026-05-25.** The binary is still
> baked into the image and `litestream.yml` still ships, but no `LITESTREAM_*`
> env var is set, so `entrypoint.sh` skips both restore and replicate. Durability
> comes from the persistent NFS `/pb_data` volume plus PocketBase's built-in
> backup cron. See [Backups & disaster recovery](#backups--disaster-recovery)
> before you rely on anything in this file for a restore.

> Throughout this document, replace `<...>` placeholders with values from your environment. The repo ships zero environment-specific defaults — real values live in `.azure/<envName>/.env` (gitignored).

## Topology

| Resource | Name pattern | RG | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Resource group | `<rg-name>` (default `rg-<envName>`) | — | Created by deployment |
| ACR | `cr<resourceToken>` (Basic) | `<rg-name>` | Holds `pocketbase:latest` |
| Storage account | `<storage-account>` | `<rg-name>` | Premium **FileStorage**, NFS share `pbdata`. No blob endpoint — this kind cannot host one |
| Container Apps env | `cae-<envName>` | `<rg-name>` | Consumption profile, no console-log destination (`appLogsConfiguration.destination: null`) |
| Container App | `ca-<envName>` | `<rg-name>` | 1 vCPU / 2 GiB, **single replica** (SQLite) |
| Key Vault | `kv-<resourceToken>` | `<rg-name>` | Standard, RBAC authorization. Holds every secret the app consumes — see [Where the secrets live](#where-the-secrets-live) |
| Managed identity | `id-<envName>` | `<rg-name>` | AcrPull + **Key Vault Secrets User** on the vault above |

Everything the deployment touches lives in one resource group. There is no
observability resource and no cross-RG dependency: logs leave the process over
OTLP to SigNoz, which runs on the parish K3s cluster, not in Azure.

PocketBase data path **inside the container**: `/pb_data`, an **NFS** Azure Files
mount that persists across pod restarts and across PocketBase's own
`syscall.Exec` self-restart. NFS (not SMB) is required: SMB does not honor the
POSIX byte-range locks SQLite WAL mode needs, and an SMB mount crashlooped with
`SQLITE_BUSY (5)` (fixed in `6a4f04df`). That in turn is why the environment is
VNet-integrated and the storage account is Premium FileStorage — Container Apps
only supports NFS Azure Files under those conditions.

## Prerequisites (one-time)

1. `az login` and `azd auth login`.
2. The signed-in principal needs:
   - `Contributor` on the subscription (or on `<rg-name>` after first create). That is the only role the deployment needs — nothing outside `<rg-name>` is touched.
   - No Key Vault **data-plane** role. The deployment writes vault secrets through the ARM control plane, which `Contributor` already covers. You only need `Key Vault Secrets Officer` to run `az keyvault secret set` by hand.
3. Set required azd env vars (all values stay in the gitignored `.azure/<envName>/.env`):
   ```sh
   azd env new <envname>           # e.g. prod
   azd env set AZURE_LOCATION       <region>           # e.g. westus
   azd env set PB_ADMIN_EMAIL       you@example.com
   azd env set PB_ADMIN_PASSWORD    '<strong-pass>'    # quote to survive zsh
   azd env set AZURE_STORAGE_NAME   <storage-account>  # 3-24 chars, lowercase alphanumeric
   # Optional — defaults to rg-<envName> if unset:
   azd env set AZURE_RG_NAME        <rg-name>
   ```

## Three-pass deployment

The custom-domain + free managed cert flow has an unavoidable chicken-and-egg step: domain ownership must be verified at the DNS layer **before** Azure will issue the cert. So the first deploy is intentionally bare, then you add DNS records, then you re-deploy to bind the domain + cert.

### Pass 1 — initial deploy (no custom domain)

```sh
azd up
```

This builds the image, pushes to ACR, and stands up everything except the custom domain binding. When it finishes, capture two values:

```sh
azd env get-value AZURE_CONTAINER_APP_FQDN
azd env get-value AZURE_CONTAINER_APP_CUSTOM_DOMAIN_VERIFICATION_ID
```

Sanity check the app responds:

```sh
curl -fsS "https://$(azd env get-value AZURE_CONTAINER_APP_FQDN)/api/health"
```

### Pass 2 — add DNS records

Add the following records at your DNS provider for `<your-domain>` (replace `<host>` with the subdomain, e.g. `auth`):

| Type | Host | Value | TTL |
|------|------|-------|-----|
| `CNAME` | `<host>` | `<AZURE_CONTAINER_APP_FQDN>` | 1 hr |
| `TXT` | `asuid.<host>` | `<AZURE_CONTAINER_APP_CUSTOM_DOMAIN_VERIFICATION_ID>` (raw, no quotes) | 1 hr |

Wait 5–15 minutes, then verify both records resolve:

```sh
./scripts/verify-dns.sh <host>.<your-domain> <rg-name> ca-<envName>
```

Do **not** proceed to pass 3 until both checks return `OK`. The cert resource will hard-fail validation otherwise and the deployment rolls back.

> **Never delete the `asuid` TXT record** — Azure re-checks it on every cert renewal.

### Pass 3 — bind domain + issue managed cert

```sh
azd env set CUSTOM_DOMAIN <host>.<your-domain>
azd up
```

This:
1. Creates `Microsoft.App/managedEnvironments/managedCertificates` named after the domain (dots replaced with dashes).
2. Validates the CNAME + asuid TXT records.
3. Issues a free DigiCert TLS cert tied to the env (auto-renews).
4. Binds the cert to the Container App ingress with `SniEnabled`.

Verify:

```sh
curl -fsS https://<host>.<your-domain>/api/health
```

HTTP → HTTPS redirect is automatic (`allowInsecure: false`).

## Common operations

### Push code-only changes (no infra change)
```sh
azd deploy
```

### Force an infra-only update
```sh
azd provision
```

### Rotate the PocketBase admin password
```sh
azd env set PB_ADMIN_PASSWORD '<new>'
azd provision
```
`azd provision` writes the new value to the Key Vault secret
`pb-admin-password`. The container app references it by a **versionless** URI, so
Container Apps picks the new version up within 30 minutes and restarts the
revision; the entrypoint then runs `pocketbase superuser upsert`. The restart is
not immediate and is a short downtime window at `maxReplicas: 1` — see
[Where the secrets live](#where-the-secrets-live) for the full rotation story and
for the GitHub Actions path.

### View logs

**Live, from the running replica** — this is the only way to see console output
from Azure:
```sh
az containerapp logs show -n ca-<envName> -g <rg-name> --follow
```
Log streaming reads from the replica itself, so it works even though the
environment stores nothing
([log streaming](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/log-streaming)).

**Retained history** lives in SigNoz, not Azure. The environment is configured
with no logs destination, so there is no `ContainerAppConsoleLogs_CL` table, no
KQL to run, and the portal's **Logs** query editor is disabled for this
environment ([log options](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/log-options)).
Query `service.name=stfoa-auth` in SigNoz instead — see
[Telemetry — OTLP export to SigNoz](#telemetry--otlp-export-to-signoz).

Two consequences worth knowing before you go looking:

- Anything written to stdout/stderr that is **not** a PocketBase log record —
  `entrypoint.sh` output, crash output, the Go runtime's panic trace — is
  retained nowhere once the replica is gone. That is why the handover writes to
  `/pb_data/.pb_handover.log` and mirrors WARNs through the OTLP sink.
- A container that dies before PocketBase's logger starts leaves no trace in
  SigNoz. Catch that case with `az containerapp revision list` /
  `az containerapp replica list` plus the stream above, while it is still alive.

## Where the secrets live

Every secret the container app consumes is stored in the deployment's **Key
Vault** and reaches the app as a **Key Vault reference** — the `secrets` array on
the Container App holds a `keyVaultUrl` plus the managed identity to read it
with, never the value.

That matters because `az containerapp secret show` returns raw secret **values in
plaintext** to any principal holding `Microsoft.App/containerApps/listSecrets/action`,
and several built-in roles grant it through wildcards — including *Container Apps
Operator*, whose description implies read-only operational access
([Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/manage-secrets#permissions-for-managing-secrets)).
With references there is no stored value for that call to return.

| Container Apps secret | Key Vault secret | Env var | Source of truth | URI |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `pb-admin-email` | `pb-admin-email` | `PB_ADMIN_EMAIL` | repo secret `PB_ADMIN_EMAIL` | versionless |
| `pb-admin-password` | `pb-admin-password` | `PB_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | repo secret `PB_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | versionless |
| `otlp-auth-header` | `otlp-auth-header` | `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` | repo secret `OTLP_AUTH_HEADER` | versionless |

That is the whole list — if a future change adds a secret to the container app,
it goes in the vault too. The invariant to check is not "these three names are
absent" but **"the app's `secrets` array has no `value` field at all"**.

Find the vault:

```sh
az keyvault list -g <rg-name> --query "[].name" -o tsv
```

Confirm no values are exposed on the app — each entry must show a `keyVaultUrl`
and an `identity`, and **no** `value`:

```sh
az containerapp secret show -n ca-<envName> -g <rg-name> --secret-name pb-admin-password
```

### How a deploy populates the vault

`infra/modules/keyvault.bicep` writes the secret values; the app never receives
them. The chain is `identity` → `keyvault` (secrets + role grant) → `container-app`,
and that order is mandatory because Key Vault data-plane RBAC can take **up to 10
minutes** to propagate after ARM reports the role assignment created
([Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/troubleshoot-deployment-errors#app-starts-with-missing-configuration)).
Granting first is necessary but not sufficient.

**An unresolvable reference has two documented outcomes, and you cannot predict
which one you get:**

- **The write is rejected and the deploy goes red.** Container Apps validates that
  references resolve to a non-empty value during deployment
  ([Microsoft support answer, 2026-07](https://learn.microsoft.com/answers/a/12888502)).
  This is the safe case — the running revision is untouched.
- **The deploy goes green and the env var arrives empty.** Learn's own
  troubleshooting flow has a whole section for "an expected configuration value …
  is empty or missing at runtime", and lists `Authorization failed on Key Vault`
  and `RBAC permission denied` as causes under it. So the app can come up
  *degraded*: no superuser bootstrap, and unauthenticated (i.e. dropped) OTLP
  export, with nothing in the deploy result to say so.

The second case is the one that bites, and at `maxReplicas: 1` it happens *after*
`acquire_single_writer` has already drained the healthy outgoing replica.

**So verify delivery, do not infer it.** After a deploy that touched the vault or
the identity:

```sh
# Key Vault sync errors surface as SYSTEM logs, not console logs:
az containerapp logs show -n ca-<envName> -g <rg-name> --type system --tail 50

# Then confirm the app actually got the values:
curl -fsS https://<custom-domain>/api/health
az containerapp logs show -n ca-<envName> -g <rg-name> --tail 100   # superuser upsert ran?
```

Two more consequences worth knowing:

- The secrets are written through the **ARM control plane**
  (`Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets/write`, part of `Contributor`), not the data
  plane. The CI service principal therefore needs **no** Key Vault role. A human
  running `az keyvault secret set` does — `Key Vault Secrets Officer`.
- A deploy **rewrites the vault from the GitHub repo secrets**. The repo secrets
  are the source of truth; the vault is the delivery mechanism. An out-of-band
  vault edit is reverted by the next deploy.

### Rotating a secret

Prefer the repo secret, so the change survives the next deploy:

```sh
gh secret set PB_ADMIN_PASSWORD --repo doodlemania2/pocketbase
```

Then merge a PR into `deploy/azure` (see the production warning at the top of
this file). Confirm the new version landed:

```sh
az keyvault secret list-versions --vault-name <kv-name> --name pb-admin-password \
  -o table --query "[].{created:attributes.created,enabled:attributes.enabled}"
```

All three secrets use **versionless** URIs, so you can also rotate the vault
directly for a fast fix, without a deploy:

```sh
az keyvault secret set --vault-name <kv-name> --name otlp-auth-header --value '<new>'
```

Container Apps picks up the new version **within 30 minutes** and then
**automatically restarts the active revision** to apply it
([Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/manage-secrets#key-vault-secret-uri-and-secret-rotation)).
At `maxReplicas: 1` that restart is a short downtime window through the
`/pb_data` handover path, and it happens on the platform's schedule, not yours.
Update the matching repo secret in the same sitting or the next deploy silently
reverts you.

> ⚠️ **Versionless is only safe because all three secrets are rotatable in
> place.** A secret whose value the app cannot survive changing must be
> **version-pinned** instead (`secretUriWithVersion` out of `keyvault.bicep`), or

### What this does not fix

`Contributor` on the resource group is still a path to these values. The vault
uses `enableRbacAuthorization: true`, which closes the "grant yourself an access
policy" shortcut, but a Contributor can flip that flag back, or assign itself
`Key Vault Secrets User`. This change removes the **one-command, role-implied**
read (`az containerapp secret show`) and replaces it with several deliberate,
separately-audited control-plane changes. Tightening RG-level `Contributor` is
the remaining work and is out of scope here.

The vault has no firewall or private endpoint. Container Apps resolves references
from the platform rather than from the app's VNet subnet, so restricting network
access needs extra plumbing; a private endpoint would also cost roughly $7/month
against $0 today. Access is gated by RBAC, not by network position.

## Backups & disaster recovery

Durability rests on two independent things — **neither of them is Litestream**:

1. **The persistent NFS `/pb_data` volume.** Survives pod restarts, revision
   swaps, and PocketBase's `syscall.Exec` self-restart.
2. **PocketBase's native backup cron.** Configured in the superuser dashboard
   under *Settings → Backups*, currently running daily at midnight with an S3
   target. This is the only off-box copy of the data.

### Verify backups are landing

There is no blob replica to inspect — the storage account is FileStorage and has
no blob endpoint. Check the backup list through the API instead:

```sh
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST https://<custom-domain>/api/collections/_superusers/auth-with-password \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"identity":"<admin-email>","password":"<password>"}' | jq -r .token)
curl -s https://<custom-domain>/api/backups -H "Authorization: $TOKEN" | jq '.[].key'
```

The newest entry should be from the last 24 h. Also confirm the S3 bucket
directly — the API list reflects the configured storage, but a bucket-side check
is the one that proves the object actually landed.

> **Backup failures can be silent.** `CreateBackup` reports errors through
> `app.Logger()`, which writes to `auxiliary.db`. If that database is damaged the
> error may never reach the log — and note that the batch writer at
> [core/base.go](core/base.go) swallows per-row write errors (it prints them to
> stderr and returns `nil`, so the transaction still commits), meaning log loss
> is silent and partial rather than a loud failure. The only other alarm is the
> superuser email from `sendSystemAlertToAllSuperusers`, which needs working
> SMTP. Treat "no errors in the log" as weak evidence; check the bucket.

### Restore (disaster recovery)

**Do not delete `/pb_data/data.db` expecting an automatic restore.** There is no
replica to restore from. `litestream_restore()` in [entrypoint.sh](entrypoint.sh)
is gated on `LITESTREAM_REPLICA_URL`, which is unset, so it is a no-op —
PocketBase would simply create an empty database and the deleted data would be
gone. (Earlier revisions of this runbook documented exactly that procedure. It
was correct only while Litestream was enabled, before 2026-05-25.)

To restore, use the dashboard: *Settings → Backups → upload/select a backup →
Restore*. PocketBase swaps `pb_data` and self-restarts via `syscall.Exec`.
Expect to lose up to one backup interval (24 h) of writes — for this app that
means recently enrolled passkeys, whose owners will need to re-register.

### Recovering a corrupt `auxiliary.db`

`auxiliary.db` holds only the `_logs` table
([migrations/1640988000_aux_init.go](migrations/1640988000_aux_init.go)), so it is
safe to set aside. Symptom is `database disk image is malformed (11)` spamming
the console on request-log writes.

**Confirming it, without a shell.** In the dashboard, open *Logs* and read the
newest entry's timestamp. If it is frozen days or months in the past while the
console error is still streaming, logging is dead. Do not infer health from
"I can see logs" — the UI happily renders frozen history. Corroborate on the
volume: a healthy `auxiliary.db-wal` grows continuously; a **0-byte WAL beside a
stale `auxiliary.db` mtime means nothing is being written**.

**`az containerapp exec` needs a real TTY** and fails with
`termios.error: (19, 'Operation not supported by device')` from a non-interactive
shell. Wrap it, and note that nested `sh -c '...'` quoting does not survive the
websocket — issue one plain command per call. The exec endpoint also rate-limits
aggressively (HTTP 429, `retry-after: 600`), so batch your intent into as few
calls as possible.

```sh
REV=$(az containerapp show -g <rg-name> -n ca-<envName> --query properties.latestReadyRevisionName -o tsv)

# preserve rather than delete — matches the existing .recover-YYYY-MM-DD convention in /pb_data
script -q /dev/null az containerapp exec -g <rg-name> -n ca-<envName> --revision "$REV" \
  --command "mkdir -p /pb_data/.recover-$(date +%F)"
script -q /dev/null az containerapp exec -g <rg-name> -n ca-<envName> --revision "$REV" \
  --command "mv /pb_data/auxiliary.db /pb_data/auxiliary.db-wal /pb_data/auxiliary.db-shm /pb_data/.recover-$(date +%F)/"

az containerapp revision restart -g <rg-name> -n ca-<envName> --revision "$REV"
```

The `ReapplyCondition` on the aux-init migration recreates `_logs` on next boot.
Verify by confirming a fresh small `auxiliary.db` plus a **growing** WAL, and that
new entries appear in the dashboard *Logs* view.

**Why it happens — deploys, not midnight crons.** It has recurred five times:
`/pb_data/.recover-2026-06-09`, `.recover-2026-08-15`, `.recover-2026-08-31`,
`.recover-2026-09-06` and `.recover-2026-09-06-2210`. An earlier revision of this
document blamed contention between `__pbDBOptimize__`, `__pbLogsCleanup__` and
the backup cron at midnight. **That was wrong**, and the mitigation it proposed —
moving the backup cron to `0 2 * * *` — was applied and corruption recurred
anyway.

The cause is the *rollout*. Container Apps performs a rolling revision
transition: the incoming replica is started and made **ready** before the
outgoing one is drained, so two PocketBase processes hold the same NFS
`/pb_data` for around 40 seconds. `maxReplicas: 1` does not prevent it, because
that bounds replicas per revision, not across a transition. Console logs carry
`RevisionName_s`, which makes the overlap directly observable — two revisions
emitting request logs in the same second:

```kql
ContainerAppConsoleLogs_CL
| where ContainerAppName_s == 'ca-auth'
| where TimeGenerated between (datetime(2026-09-05T19:20:00Z) .. datetime(2026-09-05T19:35:00Z))
| summarize started=min(TimeGenerated), ended=max(TimeGenerated) by RevisionName_s
```

Every observed onset sits inside such a window — 2026-08-31 16:23 (41 s),
2026-08-31 17:33 (41 s), 2026-09-05 19:24 (43 s), 2026-09-06 22:10 — and the app
ran 2026-09-01 to 09-04 with **zero** console output, five clean days with no
deploy in them.

**A startup lock does not fix it, and must not be reintroduced.** The obvious
remedy is to have the incoming replica take an exclusive `flock` on `/pb_data`
and wait. It was implemented and deployed on 2026-09-06, and **deadlocks**: the
handover is readiness-gated in both directions. Container Apps will not drain
the outgoing replica until the incoming one reports ready, and the incoming one
cannot report ready while blocked on a lock the outgoing one holds. On the first
`az containerapp revision restart` after it shipped the new replica logged

```
[entrypoint] acquiring single-writer lock on /pb_data (waiting up to 75s)...
[entrypoint] FATAL: another replica still holds /pb_data after 75s.
```

and exited, while the old one kept serving and kept the lock. Prod stayed up —
failing closed leaves the old replica serving — but no deploy would ever have
completed again. Reverted in `2f46f48b`. Confirmed independently against the
event stream: the outgoing revision's `RevisionDeactivating` fires *after* the
incoming revision's `Server started` (19:24:27 vs 19:24:15 on the 2026-09-05
transition).

### The fix: the outgoing replica leaves when asked

The dependency has to be inverted, so [entrypoint.sh](entrypoint.sh) does that.
The incoming replica *asks*; the outgoing one leaves of its own accord instead
of waiting to be drained:

1. The incoming replica writes its id to `/pb_data/.pb_handover`.
2. A watcher in the outgoing replica reads an id that is not its own, stops
   PocketBase, closes both databases and releases
   `/pb_data/.pb_singlewriter.lock` — without ACA having to drain it.
3. The outgoing replica then **parks**: it stays alive, failing its health
   probes, until ACA drains it. It must not exit. An exit reads as a crash to
   Container Apps, which restarts the container, and that restart races the
   genuine incoming replica for the lock and can win it — observed live on
   2026-09-06 22:49, where the incoming replica then timed out and started
   unlocked.
4. The outgoing replica records its own id in `/pb_data/.pb_released` and
   writes the incoming replica's id to `/pb_data/.pb_handover_ack`.
5. The incoming replica holds the lock **and** sees its own id in the ack. It
   writes itself to `/pb_data/.pb_owner`, clears the request, starts its own
   watcher, and serves.

### What went wrong on 2026-09-28, and the #54 hardening

The first version (steps 1–3, with the lock as the only proof) still let two
writers overlap on the v0.40.4 deploy. The incoming replica logged `WARN: no
handover after 60s` against an outgoing replica that *did* have the watcher
([#54](https://github.com/doodlemania2/pocketbase/issues/54)). The console logs
that would show exactly what happened were not retained. The evidence left on
the volume and in the code fits one sequence, and every step of it is now
closed:

| Step | What happened | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Slow release | PocketBase's OTLP flush on SIGTERM had no deadline, so it took 30s against a slow collector, measured with a blackholed endpoint | Bounded to 5s (`otelShutdownTimeout` in `core/logger_otel.go`) |
| Missed release | `flock -w` blocking on NFS re-polls with exponential backoff (…15s, 31s, 61s), so a release 31–60s in is never seen | Non-blocking `flock -n` every second |
| Lock is not proof | The incoming replica then started *without* the lock and left it free, so the next claimant would have got it instantly while the previous writer was still running | The incoming replica needs the outgoing replica's explicit **ack**, not just the lock |
| Zombie | Parked means health fails, and a failing **liveness** probe makes ACA *restart* the parked container after ~60–90s (the lock file's mtime moved at 16:24:17, a minute after the new replica started). The restart re-ran the entrypoint, found the lock free, and served | A replica listed in `.pb_released` parks on restart instead of serving. The serving replica also ignores handover requests from released replicas and from **older** azd revisions (the pod name carries the revision's deploy epoch) |

Two cases still start without an ack, both with a WARN. The first is the one
deploy that introduces the ack, because the outgoing replica runs the pre-#54
entrypoint. It still releases when asked, but never acks, so the incoming
replica holds the lock and waits out the full `PB_HANDOVER_TIMEOUT`. The second
is a previous replica whose pod died outright. A **fresh volume** (no lock file
yet) and a replica's **own container restarting** (it is `.pb_owner`) skip the
ack wait, since no one else can be writing.

What this looks like in the console on a healthy rollout:

```
[entrypoint] waiting for the previous replica (ca-auth--azd-...-prb44) to release /pb_data (up to 60s)...  <- incoming
[entrypoint] handover requested by 'ca-auth--azd-...-x7k2m' — releasing /pb_data.                         <- outgoing
[entrypoint] handover: stopping pocketbase and releasing /pb_data...                                      <- outgoing
[entrypoint] handover: /pb_data released to '...'. Parking until this replica is drained.                 <- outgoing
[entrypoint] /pb_data is ours after 4s — single writer confirmed.                                         <- incoming
[entrypoint] this replica already handed /pb_data over; parking instead of serving (...)                  <- outgoing, after a liveness restart
```

**Every handover event is durable.** The Container Apps environment keeps no
console logs (Log Analytics was removed in #51/#52), so the entrypoint appends
each event to `/pb_data/.pb_handover.log` (last 500 lines) and sends every WARN
to the OTLP collector as a log record with `source=single-writer-handover`.
That record reaches SigNoz with the same `service.name` as PocketBase's own
logs, so alert on it there. To read the file:

```sh
script -q /dev/null az containerapp exec -g stfoa-auth -n ca-auth --command "tail -n 40 /pb_data/.pb_handover.log"
```

**It fails open on purpose.** If the wait expires the incoming replica starts
anyway, with a WARN. That is what keeps the deadlock above from ever recurring.
A brief overlap is recoverable; a container app that can no longer be deployed
is not. **`no handover after Ns — the lock is still held` means two writers
shared the volume**, so treat it as the corruption alarm it is. `never
acknowledged` is expected exactly once, on the deploy that introduces the ack.
Any later occurrence needs a look.

`PB_HANDOVER_TIMEOUT` (default 60 s) bounds the wait; the normal wait is a poll
interval plus a graceful drain, a few seconds. `PB_HANDOVER_TIMEOUT=0` disables
the mechanism entirely and should only ever be used for a single-node local run.
The startup probe allows 140 s, so even the full timeout leaves room to bind a
port.

**Tests.** [scripts/test_entrypoint_handover.sh](scripts/test_entrypoint_handover.sh)
drives the entrypoint against a shared directory with a fake `pocketbase` and
fails on any moment where two servers run at once. It covers a normal handover,
a 35s release, the pre-#54 → #54 transition, a zombie restart, and an owner
restart. Run it locally with `brew install flock dash`.
[.github/workflows/test.yml](.github/workflows/test.yml) runs it under busybox
in `alpine:3` (prod's shell), including the transition from whatever
`deploy/azure` currently deploys. It also runs the real image as two containers
on one Docker volume, asserting that the outgoing replica parks and that a
`docker restart` of it (the liveness case) parks again rather than serving.

## Failure modes & fixes

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Pass 3 fails with `Domain ownership verification failed` | DNS records not propagated yet | Re-check `dig`, wait, re-run `azd up` |
| `ResourceNotFound` on a Log Analytics workspace or App Insights component during provision | Someone reintroduced the retired cross-RG observability reference | Remove it. Logging is SigNoz-only; see [#50](https://github.com/doodlemania2/pocketbase/issues/50) for the outage this caused |
| App returns 502 briefly after deploy | New revision still starting, possibly waiting on the handover | Expected; startup probe allows up to 140 s |
| `database disk image is malformed (11)` spam in logs | `auxiliary.db` corrupt — a deploy ran two replicas over one NFS volume | See [Recovering a corrupt `auxiliary.db`](#recovering-a-corrupt-auxiliarydb). The handover in `entrypoint.sh` prevents new occurrences |
| `WARN: no handover after 60s — the lock is still held` on a rollout | The outgoing replica never let go, so this one started without the lock | Two writers shared `/pb_data`. Check `auxiliary.db` and read [#35](https://github.com/doodlemania2/pocketbase/issues/35) / [#54](https://github.com/doodlemania2/pocketbase/issues/54) |
| `WARN: lock held, but the previous replica ... never acknowledged` | The outgoing replica released without acking, or its pod died | Expected once, on the deploy that introduced the ack (#54). Otherwise check `/pb_data/.pb_handover.log` for the outgoing side |
| Container crashloops with `SQLITE_BUSY (5)` | `/pb_data` mounted over SMB instead of NFS | SMB lacks POSIX byte-range locks. Storage must be Premium FileStorage + NFS, env VNet-integrated (`6a4f04df`) |
| `customDomains` value rejected | Cert resource was deleted out-of-band | Set `CUSTOM_DOMAIN=` (empty) and re-deploy, then redo passes 2–3 |
| Two replicas running (data corruption risk) | Someone bumped `maxReplicas` | Revert — SQLite is single-writer; `maxReplicas: 1` is enforced in [infra/modules/container-app.bicep](infra/modules/container-app.bicep) |
| Deploy fails writing the container app, citing a Key Vault reference the identity cannot fetch | The `Key Vault Secrets User` grant had not propagated yet, or the vault secret is empty/disabled | The module order (`identity` → `keyvault` → `container-app`) covers the ordering; data-plane RBAC can still take up to 10 minutes. Re-run `azd provision` — it is idempotent. The running revision is untouched |
| Deploy goes **green** but the superuser upsert never ran, or OTLP export is silently unauthenticated | Same cause, other documented outcome — the reference did not resolve and the env var arrived **empty**, which does not always fail the deploy | `az containerapp logs show --type system --tail 50` for the sync error, then `az role assignment list --assignee <identity-principal-id> --scope <vault-id>`. See [Where the secrets live](#where-the-secrets-live) |
| App boots but a secret-backed env var is empty | The vault secret is disabled, or the reference points at a deleted version | `az keyvault secret show --vault-name <kv-name> --name <secret>` and check `attributes.enabled`. See [Where the secrets live](#where-the-secrets-live) |
| A rotated secret has not taken effect | Versionless references refresh on the platform's schedule, up to 30 minutes | Wait, or force it with `az containerapp revision restart` |

## Telemetry — OTLP export to SigNoz

PocketBase's logger writes to `auxiliary.db`. When that database broke on
2026-06-12 every request log was dropped and nothing said so for two months
(see [Recovering a corrupt `auxiliary.db`](#recovering-a-corrupt-auxiliarydb)).
[core/logger_otel.go](core/logger_otel.go) adds a second, independent sink: the
same records also go to the self-hosted OTLP collector, so a local-sink failure
is visible immediately instead of silently.

This follows the shared parish contract — `docs/observability/otlp-onboarding.md`
in the **STFoA-Church** repo. Read that first; it is canonical if anything here
disagrees.

### Turning it on

Everything is driven by GitHub repo variables plus one secret. With
`OTLP_ENDPOINT` unset, export is disabled and PocketBase logs exactly as
upstream does — no code path is entered.

| Setting | Kind | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `OTLP_ENDPOINT` | variable | `https://otlp.thedoodleproject.net` (endpoint **root** — the SDK appends `/v1/logs`) |
| `OTLP_AUTH_HEADER` | **secret** | `Authorization=Bearer <ingest-token>` |
| `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` | variable | `stfoa-auth` (default). One per app, and **never change it** — it is the key SigNoz groups on |
| `OTEL_ENVIRONMENT` | variable | `production` (default) \| `staging` \| `development` |
| `OTEL_MIN_LEVEL` | variable | optional `DEBUG`\|`INFO`\|`WARN`\|`ERROR` — see cost note below |

Read the ingest token off the cluster and store it as a repo secret; it is one
shared token for all three signal paths:

```sh
kubectl -n signoz get secret otlp-ingest-token -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 -d
```

`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=http/protobuf` is set unconditionally in
[infra/modules/container-app.bicep](infra/modules/container-app.bicep) whenever an
endpoint is configured. Do not remove it. The collector is reached through a
Cloudflare Tunnel carrying HTTP only — an SDK that defaults to gRPC on 4317
exports nothing **and reports no error**; the app simply never appears in SigNoz.

### The sink-failure signal

The local `_logs` sink reports its own failures on the OTLP sink. This is the
part that was missing while `auxiliary.db` was dead from 2026-06-12 to
2026-08-15: PocketBase's batch writer reports a rejected row with a stdlib
`log.Println` to stderr, which never crosses `app.Logger()` and so never reached
a collector, and `PB_OTEL_MIN_LEVEL=WARN` filtered the INFO request logs whose
disappearance was the only other clue. SigNoz could not tell a dead sink from an
idle app.

Two messages now carry that state, both emitted straight to the OTLP handler —
never through `app.Logger()`, which is the sink that just failed:

| Message | Level | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `local log sink write failed` | ERROR | rows are being rejected; attributes carry `sink`, `failedRecords`, `attemptedRecords`, `failedBatches` and the SQLite `error` |
| `local log sink recovered` | WARN | the first clean batch after a failing run — the all-clear for the alert |

Both **bypass `PB_OTEL_MIN_LEVEL`** on purpose; trimming request-log volume must
not also silence the reason the second sink exists. The failure record is rate
limited to one per 5 minutes and accumulates its counts in between, so a fully
corrupt database costs 288 records a day instead of 8,600 while still reporting
the true number of dropped rows.

**Alert on `local log sink write failed`** in SigNoz, and clear on
`local log sink recovered`.

### Ingestion cost

Every request is logged at INFO, and the startup/liveness probes hit
`/api/health` every 10 s — roughly 8.6k records a day before any real traffic.
Set `OTEL_MIN_LEVEL=WARN` to cap what crosses the wire. It does not affect what
PocketBase stores locally, so the dashboard *Logs* view keeps full detail either
way.

### Verify

```sh
# 1. the gate rejects an unauthenticated request
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' -X POST https://otlp.thedoodleproject.net/v1/traces \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"resourceSpans":[]}'          # expect 401

# 2. the app is exporting: exporter errors go to stderr, never through
#    app.Logger() (that would feed failures back into the failing sink)
az containerapp logs show -g <rg-name> -n ca-<envName> --tail 50 --type console | grep '\[otel\]'
```

Then find the service in SigNoz under `service.name=stfoa-auth` with the right
`deployment.environment`. An empty `resourceSpans` array returns `200` without
proving anything reached ClickHouse — only a real record does.

## Litestream: why it is off, and what re-enabling would take

Litestream was configured early on and **deliberately disabled on 2026-05-25**
(`f9cac5e0`). Do not switch it back on without reading this — the failure mode
was worse than having no replica at all.

**Why it was turned off.** PocketBase's dashboard backup-restore performs an
in-process `syscall.Exec` self-restart. The supervising `litestream` process
survives that exec holding an open FD on the *pre-restore* inode, so it keeps
replicating the orphaned file. A consented dashboard restore left a **10 KB
malformed snapshot as the only replica**, and the entrypoint's cold-start restore
would then write that corruption onto a fresh pod. Litestream was manufacturing
bad backups and then restoring them.

**The fix exists but was never wired up.** `0d82e286` added a fork-local
`OnTerminate` hook that signals PPID before `execve`, so a supervisor can recycle
Litestream across a restore:

- [pre_restart_signal.go](pre_restart_signal.go) (unix) /
  [pre_restart_signal_other.go](pre_restart_signal_other.go) (stub)
- wired at [pocketbase.go](pocketbase.go) via `bindPreRestartSignal(pb)`
- env: `PB_PRE_RESTART_SIGNAL` (SIGTERM|SIGUSR1|SIGHUP|SIGUSR2|SIGINT|SIGQUIT),
  `PB_PRE_RESTART_DELAY_MS` (default 500). Unset = upstream behavior.

Still outstanding if you ever want the replica back:

1. Provision a **StorageV2** account with a blob container. The current
   FileStorage account cannot host one, and `storage.bicep` dropped the blob
   wiring in `6a4f04df`.
2. Add `trap "kill -TERM $LITESTREAM_PID; wait $LITESTREAM_PID" USR1` to
   [entrypoint.sh](entrypoint.sh) — it currently traps only `TERM INT`.
3. Set `PB_PRE_RESTART_SIGNAL=SIGUSR1` and the three `LITESTREAM_*` vars on the
   container app. `entrypoint.sh` and `litestream.yml` need no other changes.
4. Write a test for the pre-restart hook — there is none, so its behavior is
   unexercised.

**Is it worth it?** Against a working daily backup cron the only real gain is
RPO — seconds instead of up to 24 h. That matters here only if losing a day of
passkey enrollments is unacceptable. Weigh that against re-entering a code path
that has already caused one data-loss incident.

## Tear-down

```sh
azd down --purge
```
`--purge` is required to actually delete the ACR and Key Vault soft-delete tombstones — the vault is created with a 7-day soft-delete retention and **no** purge protection precisely so this works. Then manually delete the DNS records at your provider.
